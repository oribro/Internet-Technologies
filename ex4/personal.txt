What was hard:

Understanding how AJAX works and how all things fall into place 
(javascript combined with html combined with client-server communication)

What was easy: 

Recreating features from ex2 such as the buttons and one screen app.

Comments about the course:

- Should be organized better. i.e we were waiting for ex3 to come out for very 
long time and we could use that time to prepare for it and it's complexity.

- It allowed us to learn useful things about the internet and now we are smarter :)
